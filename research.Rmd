My research combines statistical modeling, genomic data analysis, 
and computer programming to answer fundamental questions about the nature and consequences of 
duplication in biology. Below are my three main research foci

----

### Genomics of Polyploidy

Whole genome duplication, and duplication in general, can have myriad consequences
for the organisms affected. 

 - **What are the demographic consequences of WGD?** As part of my postdoc,
 I am working to develop models for inferring past demographic events (eg,
 migration, divergence, bottlenecks) in polyploids using genome-wide SNP data.
 We have also incorporated inbreeding into these inferences.
