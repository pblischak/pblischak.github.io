I am interested in the development and application statistical models and software to understand the evolution of polyploids. 
My main focus is on understanding the evolutionary history of *Penstemon attenuatus*, a hexaploid species with four varieties distributed in the Pacific Northwest. 
A few of my projects include:

- Developing models for estimating allele frequencies in polyploids (both auto- and allopolyploids).

- Testing hypotheses of allopolyploid formation in the *Penstemon attenuatus* species complex.

- Demographic inferences with polyploids using the coalescent model.
